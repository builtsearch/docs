# Where do I start with Builtsearch Authentication?

Builtsearch Authentication is built on Firebase's authenticate and firestore services to efficiently manage authentication procedures within the platform. You have the flexibility to choose between two methods for implementation:

1. Firebase Client-side SDK:

   - Firebase offers native SDKs for various platforms, including iOS, Android, Web, Flutter, and even C++. You can seamlessly integrate these SDKs into your applications for a smooth authentication experience.

2. Firebase REST Requests:

   - If your platform falls outside the native support provided by Firebase SDKs, you can opt for Firebase REST requests to authenticate users. This method allows you to perform authentication via HTTP requests, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of technologies.

Builtsearch Authentication simplifies the process of user authentication, providing a secure and efficient solution.
